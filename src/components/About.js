          Who am I?
        My name is Ryan Hu, and I am a eb developer living in New York. I enjoy solving challenging problems,
        and adding functionality/ease of access to sites that may or may not need them. 

        I also have experience coding with others, and in a group setting, I bring cooperation to the table. 
        I have experience dealing with many different kinds of people and can bring a team together with a 
        healthy dose of respect for each member's ideas and opinions. 
        I generally like working in a group, as each person has their own set of coding tricks 
        and there is always much to learn from working with others.
